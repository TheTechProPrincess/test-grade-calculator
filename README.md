# Test Grade Calculator (Python Project)

This is a small Python project I wrote using **IDLE** for Chapter 5 – Loops.  
It’s a super useful program that lets you:
- Enter **3 test scores**
- It will **drop your lowest one**
- Then it averages the other 2
- And gives you a **letter grade** (A, B, C, D, or F)

Perfect if you want to pretend your lowest grade didn’t happen (just like real life... kind of!).

## How It Works (In Plain English)

1. You type in 3 test scores (like 78, 92, and 88).
2. The program checks that each number is between 0 and 100.
3. It finds the **lowest score** and tosses it out.
4. It averages the other two scores.
5. It figures out what letter grade that average equals.
6. It shows you:
   - The score it dropped
   - Your new average
   - Your final grade

## Example Run

If you type this into the program:

Enter test score 1: 78
Enter test score 2: 92
Enter test score 3: 88

You’ll see:

Lowest test score dropped: 78
Average test score: 90.00
Letter grade: A

## What I Learned

This helped me practice:
- **Loops** (repeating actions until something is right)
- **If/Else** (decision-making in code)
- **Input validation** (making sure users type good numbers)
- **Lists** and **math** in Python

It’s one of my first cool scripts that feels useful and real-world!

## Try It Yourself

If you have Python installed:
1. Copy the code from `grade_calculator.py`
2. Open **IDLE** or any code editor
3. Paste it in and hit **Run**
4. Try entering your own test scores!
